# ImageNet
The colabs are meant to be read and adapted.

## If you really want to run the colab/notebook
* Download [ImageNet](http://www.image-net.org/) (to google cloud storage) and load with [TensorFlow Datasets](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets).
* [Train ResNet-50](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/official/vision/image_classification) and save the checkpoints of each epoch either in [checkpoint](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/checkpoint)/[saved_models](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/saved_model).

## Application of TrackIn
* [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/frederick0329/TrackIn/blob/master/imagenet/resnet50_imagenet_self_influence.ipynb) Inspecting Training data with self-influence
